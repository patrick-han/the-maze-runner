# the-maze-runner


The Maze Runner is a project done for ELEC 327 at Rice University. The concept was to create a more interesting implementation of the game where you navigate a ball from start to finish by tilting the maze.

We did this by:

a) Adding servo motors to control the motion of the board

b) Controlling those servos using a wireless joystick controller


The design files for the PCB's and code are included in this repository.
